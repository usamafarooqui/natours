streams are use to process (read and write data piece by piece ) chunks , without completing the 
whole read and write operation and theirfore without keeping all the data in memory
for eg youtube videos puri video load nahi hoti pehlay piece by piece load hoti rehti hai

in node there are 4 types of streams 

1 ) readable streams
        stream from which we can consume data 
        example 
        http request 
        fs read streams 
        important events 
        data 
        end 
        important function 
        pipe()
        read()
2) writable streams 
        stream from which we can write data 
        example 
        http response 
        fs write streams 
        important events 
        drain  
        finish 
        important function 
        write()
        end()

3) duplex streams 
        stream from which we can do both read and  write data 
        example 
        web sockets 
        
4) transform stream 
    stream from which we can transform data as it is written or read
    example 
    zlib grib creation
